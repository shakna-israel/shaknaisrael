description: >
  The brilliant inventors of the world take what is imagined and make it a reality.<br><br>

  Such a man was David Cassidy.<br><br>

  He was a genius, a man of foresight, and a man to whom his family was everything. He helped to develop a squadron of fighters for the Americans, then when they wanted to restrict his movements, he reappeared in the United Kingdom, developing fighter planes that could truly become unseen.<br><br>

  Cassidy disappeared altogether from the pages of history.<br><br>

  History forgets itâ€™s finest at times.
